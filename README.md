# Primi-TicTacToe
A primitive, text-based tic tac toe game. This is my first project, trying to apply skills learned in a second year software design class.

As of commit #8, the actual game works and is functional. There is a minor issue in the while loop that doesn't affect gameplay but should still be fixed. The next few commits will address this and also refactor the project to make it cleaner.
